# Linear-Regression
## Objective
The objective of the BoomBike Sharing Assignment is to develop a robust and insightful business strategy to revitalize BoomBikes' revenue in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the significant revenue declines and sustainability challenges faced during the lockdown, BoomBikes aims to implement a data-driven approach to predict and manage future demand for shared bikes effectively.

To achieve this, we will build a multiple linear regression model to forecast bike-sharing demand based on various independent variables such as weather conditions, day of the week, seasonal factors, and socio-economic indicators. This model will provide a comprehensive understanding of how different factors influence bike rental demand, allowing BoomBikes to optimize their operations and resource allocation.

By accurately predicting demand, BoomBikes can ensure adequate bike availability on high-demand days, such as warm, sunny days, while also strategizing to increase bookings during adverse weather conditions through targeted promotions and offers. This predictive capability will enable BoomBikes to better meet customer expectations, improve user satisfaction, and ultimately enhance revenue streams.

## Business Goal 
The business goal is to model shared bike demand using various independent variables. This will help management understand demand variations, allowing them to adjust strategies to meet customer expectations and optimize operations. Additionally, the model will provide insights into demand dynamics for potential new markets

# Conclussion 
Understanding various factors like holidays, temperature, humidity, windspeed, seasons, specific months, and year-over-year trends is crucial for predicting and managing bike-sharing demand. These variables significantly influence biking behavior, with higher temperatures and weekends generally increasing demand, while adverse weather conditions and high windspeed reduce it. By analyzing these factors, BoomBikes can optimize marketing, fleet management, and service provision.
This data-driven approach will enable the company to meet customer expectations, improve operational efficiency, and strategically plan for demand fluctuations, ultimately supporting the company's recovery and growth post-pandemic.
